TeachMate is an AI-powered educational tool that transforms voice input into structured learning content. It transcribes spoken audio using Google's Speech API, summarizes it with GPT-3.5, generates MCQ quizzes, and creates topic-relevant images using DALL·E. 
The system is built in Python with a user-friendly Gradio interface. It helps students and teachers by simplifying learning through automatic content generation. 
The project runs on basic hardware and requires only an internet connection. TeachMate supports interactive, personalized, and accessible education. Future improvements include multilingual support, real-time use, and performance dashboards.
